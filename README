SC Racing Dashboard

Made with love for best elec lead, Seth Krieger

Designed by Eric Chen
Thanks, to Jack Eagan and Stephen Baker for technical support understanding the teensy and screen

Special Thanks for Vihan Raj for developing CAN together and hardware debugging the hell outta the car

Current stage:
	- All critical functions are completed for Driver's Dashboard 
	- Implementing customized CAN code from the ECU to Dash
	- Inheritance is now available for any derived class on display class
	- Debug is half done
	- CAN works with old ECU AEM Infinity 7
	- Includes a namespace for SCRCAN

Future stages:
	- Touchscreen capability
	- Other sensor data such as tyre temps and throttle position
	- Other modes for the car
	- Developing a SC_CAN library for use in other programs

Inheritance Chart:

display.h is a base class sending info to the dash
	-> debug_screen.h is a public derived class from display.h

main.cpp has a display and SRCCAN



This directory is intended for PlatformIO Unit Testing and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.
